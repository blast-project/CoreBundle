## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting bugs and suggesting enhancements

Before creating issues, please check [this list](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Ablast-project+sort%3Acomments-desc) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a [new issue](https://github.com/blast-project/CoreBundle/issues/new), please include as many details as possible to help maintainers reproduce the problem or understand your suggestion.


### Submitting changes

Like most projects, we propose a standard [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) for contributions:

1. Fork
2. Create a topic branch
3. Add commits
4. Create a Pull Request
5. Discuss and review your code
6. Merge

If you want to submit changes, please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/blast-project/CoreBundle/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/)). Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit) and always write a clear log message for your commits to help maintainers understand and review your submission.
